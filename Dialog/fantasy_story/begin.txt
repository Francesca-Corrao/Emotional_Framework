I know it is a very difficult potion to distillate, made with Sundrop flower, volcanos ashes and the water from a river full of alligators._But you are one of the novice wizard of great Master Azidel and this will be your final test so I am sure you will make it without many problem. In any case I am here to help you found what you need and I hope this is only the first of our adventures together._So I think we should start now if we want to be the first to finish and win the 10.000 grand that there is on stake. But don't forget what else is at stakes: your future as a wizard! You must be very careful with the choice you'll make during our adventure._We could go to the market to see if they have any ingredients there. We also could go look for the ingredients ourselves. This would be an amazing adventure we could discover so many places ! ",
