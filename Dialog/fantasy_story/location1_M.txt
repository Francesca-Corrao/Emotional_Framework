We should go and see if they have the one we need. So you think that is the Sundrop flower ? I know you had a lot of botanical lesson and should be able to recognize it by yourself. But, if you want, I have the tool for scan it and see if it is the right one. The process will take some time. But since it is not very cheap and we didn't spend much time travel to get here probably we can afford to be extra sure. Remember that there is a 10.000 grand and your wizard career at stakes!",
